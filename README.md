## **IBM-FE – User Registration with Validation**

### **Description**

**IBM-FE – User Registration with Validation** is a simple and interactive **frontend web application** that allows users to register by entering their details such as name, email, and password. It includes **form validation** to ensure the accuracy and security of user inputs before submission. The project focuses on providing a smooth and error-free registration process using only frontend technologies.

### **Features**

* User Registration Form with input fields (Name, Email, Password, Confirm Password)
* Real-time form validation using JavaScript
* Error messages for invalid inputs (e.g., invalid email or weak password)
* Password strength checker
* Responsive and user-friendly interface
* Reset and Submit button functionality
* Frontend-only implementation (no backend connection)

### **Overview**

Users can open the registration page, fill out their details, and instantly see validation messages if they enter incorrect information.
Once all fields are valid, users can successfully submit their form and receive a success message.
This project is lightweight, responsive, and easy to use—designed to demonstrate **frontend validation logic and UI design principles.**

### **Technologies Used**

* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* **IDE:** Visual Studio Code
* **Design Framework (optional):** Bootstrap / Tailwind CSS

### **How It Works**

1. The user opens the registration form.
2. Enters details such as name, email, and password.
3. JavaScript validation checks input correctness in real time.
4. If any field is invalid, an error message is displayed.
5. When all fields are valid, the form can be submitted successfully.
6. (Optional) Form data can be logged in the console or stored locally.
